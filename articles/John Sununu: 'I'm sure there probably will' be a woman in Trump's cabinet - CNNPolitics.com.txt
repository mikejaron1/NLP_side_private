John Sununu,  a former chief of staff to President George H. W. Bush, said Thursday he's "sure" there will be a woman in Donald Trump's cabinet."Oh, I'm sure there probably will," he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota when asked about it on "New Day."The Trump supporter also said the President-elect has to prioritize appointing a national security adviser, chief of staff, secretary of state, secretary of treasury and director of the Office of Management and Budget.  "And in those places, there's certainly room for talented women, not only in those places but across the cabinet," Sununu said. In an interview this past summer, Trump mentioned his daughter Ivanka Trump when asked to list possible female candidates for cabinet positions."Well there are so many different ones to choose, I can tell you everybody would say -- 'Put Ivanka in! Put Ivanka in!' You know that, right?" Trump replied."She's very popular, she's done very well. And you know Ivanka very well. But there really are so many that are talented people, like you," he added. "You're so talented, I don't know if your viewers know that." The GOP nominee continued to joke about naming Savage to his cabinet. Trump attracted some criticism in May when no woman made the short list for his vice presidential pick.Former campaign manager Paul Manafort said at the time that Trump was unlikely to pick a woman or minority for the position because "that would be viewed as pandering, I think."
