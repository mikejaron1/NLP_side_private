Dear internet, we don't want to scold you, but you're making it difficult. That viral meme your friends keep sharing of Donald Trump calling Republicans "the dumbest group of voters in the country" is not true. It's not a thing. Stop sharing it. While Donald Trump has said some questionable things, he never said anything even resembling this quote:"If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific." The post says The Donald made the statement in a People Magazine interview in 1998. Except he didn't.Snopes, that mythbusting site, looked into this when it first started doing the rounds in October. That's October 2015! Trump appeared pretty regularly in People Magazine in those days. But Snopes combed through their voluminous archives and couldn't find a single interview where he said that.So when you see this meme, know that it won't be a helpful counterpoint during the Thanksgiving political debates you'll have with your family.
