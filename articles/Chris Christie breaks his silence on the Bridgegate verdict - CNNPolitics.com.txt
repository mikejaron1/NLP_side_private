New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is speaking out following Friday's <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/politics/bridgegate-case-verdict-reached/">verdict in the Bridgegate case</a>, saying he has "no recollection" of discussing traffic issues related to lane closures on the George Washington Bridge. Christie has consistently denied having any knowledge of an effort to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, who did not endorse the Governor in his 2013 reelection bid, through putting in lane closures on the George Washington Bridge. Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni, two former state officials linked to Christie, were found guilty on seven counts each of various charges including conspiracy, fraud, and civil rights deprivation on Friday. Defense lawyers have said they planned to appeal the verdict. When pressed by CBS "This Morning" host Charlie Rose on whether ex-Christie ally David Wildstein informed him about the lane closures on the George Washington bridge, Christie denied being told it was politically motivated. "Even Wildstein said that all Baroni said to me that was their traffic at the George Washington Bridge, that the Mayor was not getting his phone calls returned," Christie said. "I have to tell you, I have absolutely no recollection of any of them saying anything like that to me that day.""I don't remember any of it," Christie said. "What I will tell you is this, Charlie. If they would have told me that, 'hey we are creating traffic at the George Washington Bridge in order to punish the mayor for not endorsing you, I would have remember that." "As a former federal prosecutor, I have respected these proceedings and refused to comment on the daily testimony from the trial," he said. "I will set the record straight in the coming days regarding the lies that were told by the media and in the courtroom."
