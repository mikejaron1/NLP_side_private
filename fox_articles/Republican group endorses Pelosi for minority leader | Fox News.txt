Struggling House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) won a key endorsement Thursday in her bid to beat back insurgent liberal rivals challenging her leadership position after winning the endorsement of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
The NRCC, a 527 campaign organization, issued a press release to announce its support for Pelosi, the veteran California congresswoman and former speaker of the House, against Democrats running from her left and right flanks.
“The NRCC would like to offer its full support to the embattled former speaker of the House,” the release said. “Under Nancy Pelosi’s leadership, House Democrats squandered their majority by forcing through unpopular legislation like Obamacare.”
Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan announced on Wednesday that he would challenge Pelosi, in order to appeal to more moderate voters. Meanwhile, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison is running to be head of the Democratic National Committee on a more liberal platform.
Ryan said that sticking with Pelosi amounted to Albert Einstein’s apocryphal definition of insanity as doing the “same thing over and over again and keep getting the same results.”
