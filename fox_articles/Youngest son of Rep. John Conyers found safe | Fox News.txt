Authorities said Conyers was taken to the University of Houston police department to be interviewed and then he was released to his family.
Carl Conyers' girlfriend, Daisha Lewis, told WWJ Newsradio 950 in Detroit that she was supposed to meet him on campus Wednesday, but that he never showed. When she and friends checked his apartment they found some clothes and other items missing.
Corey Gentry, a friend of Conyers, told Click 2 Houston that Conyers was displaying “unusual behavior.”
Congressional officials were monitoring the search. A senior House Democratic source told Fox News that they were "worried" about the younger Conyers and that the situation may be serious.
Released images of Conyers showed him with a beard, although investigators said he recently shaved it.
The 87-year-old Rep. Conyers, D-Mich., is the longest-serving member of the House. First elected in 1964, Conyers won his 27th term last week.
